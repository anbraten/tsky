tsky is still in active development and is not ready for production use. If you want to contribute to the project, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file or join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KPD7XPUZn3).

tsky is a lightweight, fast, universal and typed Bluesky API wrapper for Apps & Bots. It's designed to be easy to use, lightweight and straightforward to use. It's built with TypeScript and has full type support.

It was primarily built for the [Nimbus Client](https://github.com/nimbus-town/nimbus) but can be used in any other project that requires Bluesky API integration.

## Installation

```bash
# NPM
npm install tsky

# Yarn
yarn add tsky

# PNPM
pnpm add tsky

# Bun
bun add tsky
```

## Usage

Use an identity & password login:

```ts
import { Tsky } from 'tsky';
import { CredentialManager } from '@atcute/client';

// use either the credential manager
const manager = new CredentialManager({ service: 'https://bsky.social' });
await manager.login({
  identifier: 'alice.tsky.dev',
  password: 'password',
});
```

or the [@atcute/oauth-browser-client](https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute/tree/trunk/packages/oauth/browser-client):

```ts
import { Tsky } from 'tsky';
import { OAuthUserAgent, finalizeAuthorization } from '@atcute/oauth-browser-client';

// `createAuthorizationUrl` asks for the server to redirect here with the
// parameters assigned in the hash, not the search string.
const params = new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1));

// this is optional, but after retrieving the parameters, we should ideally
// scrub it from history to prevent this authorization state to be replayed,
// just for good measure.
history.replaceState(null, '', location.pathname + location.search);

// you'd be given a session object that you can then pass to OAuthUserAgent!
const session = await finalizeAuthorization(params);

// now you can start making requests!
const manager = new OAuthUserAgent(session);
```

and then initialize the tsky client:

```ts
const tsky = new Tsky(manager);

// get the profile of a user
const profile = await tsky.bsky.profile('did:plc:giohuovwawlijq7jkuysq5dd');

console.log(profile.handle);
```
